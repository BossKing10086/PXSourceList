#PXSourceList

`PXSourceList` is an `NSOutlineView` subclass used for easily implementing Source Lists in your applications.

PXSourceList requires the OS X 10.7 SDK and above and is licensed under the New BSD License.

![PXSourceList in action: The view-based example project included in the repository.](https://raw.github.com/Perspx/PXSourceList/master/Examples/Screenshots/PXSourceList-ViewBased-Example.png)

## Motivation
[Source Lists][2] are used in a lot of OS X applications, but the support for such controls is quite primitive – at best Cocoa allows you to create an outline view with Source List-style highlighting, but none of the features common to idiomatic Source Lists such as badging, and all top-level items being displayed differently are built in by default.

`PXSourceList` implements lots of this idiomatic behaviour for you, which makes adding a Source List to your applications a lot easier and quicker.

## Using `PXSourceList`

### Getting the code

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Perspx/PXSourceList.git

### Adding `PXSourceList` to your application

 1. Drag an `NSOutlineView` object into the window/view that you're displaying the Source List in.
 2. In the Identity inspector for the outline view, change the class from the default (`NSOutlineView`) to `PXSourceList`.
 3. With the *Source List* selected, select "Source List" for the "Highlight" attribute in the Attributes inspector under the "Table View" section.
 4. Control-click on the Source List and drag connectors to the object(s) that you want to be your Source List's delegate and data source, selecting "delegate" or "dataSource" respectively from the popup menu that is shown when you release the mouse button. A Source List *requires* a data source object, but having a delegate is optional.
 5. Make sure to `#import "PXSourceList.h"` for files that require it (the delegate and data source protocol files are imported in this main header), and ensure that your class(es) that are the `delegate` and/or `dataSource` for the Source List conform to the `PXSourceListDelegate` and `PXSourceListDataSource` protocols respectively.

There are also two example projects bundled with the source to see how `PXSourceList` should be used.

##How the control works
I have tried to structure PXSourceList in a way such that it fits common Cocoa design patterns and therefore makes it easier to use.

PXSourceList adapts the delegate and data source design patterns, and extends those of the `NSOutlineViewDelegate` and `NSOutlineViewDataSource`, much in the way that these extend the appropriate `NSTableView` protocols.

If you want more information have a look at the [Outline View Programming Topics for Cocoa][4] – the Source List delegate and data source implementation work in much the same way, but with methods added and removed, as detailed in the documentation.

##Documentation
`PXSourceList` and its related classes and protocols are documented in the header files included in the repository using [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/)-style documentation.

Documentation (in HTML and docset formats) can be generated by building the *Documentation* target from the Xcode project. The resulting documentation will be placed in `docs/` in the root directory of the project. Note that appledoc has to be installed and the script which builds the documentation expects it to be under `/usr/local/bin`.

If you notice any mistakes or feel that any areas of the documentation are lacking or missing, please file a GitHub issue.

##Known Issues

  - Calling `delegate` or `dataSource` on the Source List returns the Source List instance. This is, unfortunately, a side effect of how delegate and data source methods are handled within the Source List – I hope to work around it in the future.
  - No bindings implementation (yet).

##Attribution

I was spurred along the way by many sources, but in particular [BWToolkit][8] by Brandon Walkin and Fraser Kuyvenhoven, which gave me the idea of how to handle the Source List delegate and data source methods.

Also Brian Dunagan's post on [Source List badging][9] and determining state for the various colours was a great help when I came to the drawing code for that.

The documentation was created using [Doxygen][10] and [appledoc][11], thanks of which go to the developers of both.

The icons used in the example projects bundled with the source code are from the [Fugue icon set][12] by Yusuke Kamiyamane and the [Mimi Glyphs set][13] by Jeremy Salée.
